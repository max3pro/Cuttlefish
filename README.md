Widget displays system (CPU, RAM, NET) and weather indicators.

Main reason for creating this widget is my love for the beautiful appearance and usability of use of the desktop,
which is not surprising, since we are talking about the Rainmeter ;-) 

The basic idea is to automatically match design colors based on the desktop image. To implement it, I used this Rainmeter plugin https://software.socksthefox.net/chameleon

Thus, the widget adjusts its own colors when you move it around the desktop or change (manually or in slideshow mode) the desktop background image.

To see weather indicators you need to create free account and get free API key on openweathermap.org. To do this, go to https://openweathermap.org/price, find "Free" subscription, then click "Get API key" under. Put key to Main.ini file of widget, also insert there latitude and longitude of your place (you will find appropriate comments near necessary lines of code).

The widget can display data in English or Russian, this setting can also be found in the Main.ini file.
